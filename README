Part 1 is in cs_1, part 2 in cs_2.


I am having some issue with the code for part 2 on p2, when I tested it
there, my code will go into an infinite loop when I try to exit. On my machine,
I have no issue, I can send an exit command from the client process and it will
exit the forked process, and wait for another client to connect - but on P2 it
goes into an infinite loop and won't allow another client to connect. It actually
says something about 'fork is not available at this time' when you try to run
another client.

It is a guess, but I think it has something to do with the behavior of the
"break" statement that exits the infinite loop - is the behavior different on P2?
On my machine it works with no issue.
